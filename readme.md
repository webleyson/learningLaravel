- download composer  and install it globally (move to usr/local/bin)
- run 'composer global require "laravel/installer"'
- create new laravel project (blog) - 'laravel new blog'
- routes - routes>web.php - here you assign a view to a url  (eg. welcome)
- resources>views>welcome.blade.php (blade is the laravel templating engine)
you can delete all markup here and just add basic html.. will work like a normal static page
